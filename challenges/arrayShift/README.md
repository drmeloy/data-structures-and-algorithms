# Array shift
Function should place a value into the middle of an array
`[2,4,6,8], 5` -> `[2,4,5,6,8]`
`[4,8,15,23,42], 16` -> `[4,8,15,16,23,42]`

## Challenge
Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Stretch goal
Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.
